## Steps to run application

### Design pattern used- Modular Monolith

### Step-1 RUN

- Run "npm install" to install the required Node packages.

### Step-2 Database Requirements

- Ensure the MySQL local server is installed. For a more visually effective way to view database records, install Workbench if needed for testing purposes.
- Update the database credentials accordingly in the ".env" file within your Node application (dotenv configuration) for testing.
- This will automatically generate the schema task_management_dB in your MySQL database when you run the Node server application (execute the script npm start).

### Step-3 post man collection

- I've also included the Postman collection in this repository under the file name "Task management System.postman_collection.json", which you can import and use as well.
